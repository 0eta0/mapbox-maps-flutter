# Mapbox SDK Team Repo (internal)

This is the Maps SDK team repository for internal discussions for the Maps SDK v10+ series. 

## Maps SDK Team

- PM: Tom Lee - @sbma44 
- EM: Kristen Morgan - [@knov](https://github.com/knov)

We comprise two platform-specific subteams - [@mapbox/maps-android](https://github.com/orgs/mapbox/teams/maps-android) and [@mapbox/maps-ios](https://github.com/orgs/mapbox/teams/maps-ios).

You can tag `@mapbox/maps-android` or `@mapbox/maps-ios` or tag both teams using `@mapbox/maps-sdk`. Please use these tagging mechanisms sparingly. 

## Maps SDK Repos

We maintain public development repositories for our SDKs and Example / Demo applications. Any external discussion should happen in these repos but any sensitive or internal topics regarding the development of our products should be maintained here.

- [`mapbox-maps-android`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-android/) 
- [`mapbox-maps-ios`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios/) 

Please treat the development repos as public, even though they are currently private.

_For Mapbox SDK Hydrogen, please see [`gl-internal`](https://github.com/mapbox/gl-internal/)._


## Issue Reporting

If you need to escalate an issue to the Maps SDK engineering team, please open a support request in our [mapbox-maps-android-internal](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-android-internal/issues/new/choose) or [mapbox-maps-ios-internal](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios-internal/issues/new/choose) repos.

If you just have a quick question about iOS or Android development or usage of our SDKs and can't find the answer in our docs ([ios](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/maps/overview/), [android](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/maps/overview/)), please feel free to drop in on the [#ios-victory](https://mapbox.slack.com/archives/CDGUN6SK1) and [#android-victory](https://mapbox.slack.com/archives/CAA0SH0C8) channels in slack to ask your question.
