about: Use this template to onboard a new Maps SDK team member
title: "Welcome [Name] to Maps SDK"

---

Welcome to Mapbox, <NAME> (<GITHUB HANDLE>)! This ticket will serve as your guide to the first month of ramping up on the @mapbox/maps-sdk team. Just remember, it's a marathon not a sprint.

Your first week will be focused on onboarding into general Mapbox systems and participating in the general Mapbox onboarding. During your downtime, work on configuring your development environment, making sure you have access to team-specific systems, and getting to know your new teammates.

## Other meetings of interest

- [ ] Listen in on [operational metrics review meeting](https://github.com/mapbox/ops-metrics-review#operational-metrics-review), occurs each Wednesday at 11am ET
    - Operations metrics review (or “ops metrics”) is a weekly meeting where all service teams meet and provide status updates on team projects, with a focus on operational excellence. Attendance is always optional and our team rotates through the responsibilities of presenting team updates. Ops Metrics is a great way to get a sense for what’s moving across service organizations. 
- [ ] Join the Review Forums. Review Forums occur every Thursday. There are several sessions with fresh and relevant topics each week. Someone from the team will always join to provide an update if you can't make it, but these are the best way to learn more about our maps stack and technology and beyond. 
- [ ] Join the Android All Hands each month.  
- [ ] Join the iOS All Hands each month. 

## Questions?

Feel free to ask tons of questions on Slack. We’re all here to help you succeed 🚀 welcome aboard!
