<!-- Please add labels for:
priority level (see below)
platform (ios, android, gl-native)

<!-- Priority Framework Reference
PO: Critical issue or security incident. Application does not operate (95% failure), for example due to SDK related crash that affects multiple customers on the latest version of the SDK.
P1: Customer-impacting issue or security incident that requires immediate attention from service owners. Widespread intermittent unexpected behavior impacting usability of the application. Impacts the latest SDK release. The bug impacts critical SDK functionality. The application crashes intermittently (in a way that can be reliably reproduced) which is impacting over 20% of a Mapbox customers’ own app users.
P2: High priority issue or security incident requiring action, but not affecting customers’ ability to use the product or breaching confidentiality of information. Application is operational but certain behavior is unexpected or not ideal. Or, business impact to the customer is moderate to high, directly impacting trust in product quality. Example: Application is intermittently not operational (e.g. crashes) for less than 20% of a customer’s app users due to an SDK bug, or other unexpected SDK functionality creates a moderate impact on end users with no workaround available. Does not necessitate an unplanned release.
P3: A moderate product quality issue that should be addressed, but is not affecting customers’ ability to use the product or breaching confidentiality of information. Application is operational but certain behavior is unexpected or not ideal. There is no workaround - must be fixed by Mapbox. Business impact to the customer is low. Example: The app works but specific interactions implemented with the SDK could be improved by fixing a small bug in the SDK.
P4: A minor product quality issue that should be addressed, but is not affecting customers’ ability to use the product or breaching confidentiality of information. Application is operational but certain behavior is unexpected or not ideal. There is a workaround, but for usability and product quality, the issue should be fixed on the Mapbox side. Business impact to the customer is very low. Example: The app works but specific interactions implemented with the SDK could be improved by fixing a small bug in the SDK. 
No Priority: If the issue does not fit the above categories, please do not apply a priority labels.
