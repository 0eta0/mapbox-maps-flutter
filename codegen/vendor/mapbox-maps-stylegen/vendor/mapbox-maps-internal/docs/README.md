Welcome to our brand new documentation folder. We're off to a humble start, expect more content to come soon. Meanwhile, if you want us to prioritize any specific content, please [cut a ticket](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-internal/issues) in this repo.

## Table of Contents

- [Changelog guidelines](guidelines-changelog.md): We explain our changelog formatting and compilation process.
